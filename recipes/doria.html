            <h2>What is "doria"?</h2>
                <p>Doria is a standard popular menu item at Western restaurants. It’s a gratin-like dish with rice. In Japan, it is a dish made by pouring the white sauce over buttered rice or pilaf and grilling it over an open fire. It is similar to gratin but it is a savoury meat sauce over steamed rice, covered with melted cheese and baked in the oven.</p>
                <p>A Swiss chef who worked at a hotel restaurant in Japan invented the dish in the 1930s. It was a rice casserole with seafood (shrimp), covered with bechamel sauce and cheese, and then baked in the oven.</p>
