# odin-recipes

Once this project is complete I will have utilized the very basics of HTML.
I will have built a simple website that consists of a main index page
containing links to separate pages. These pages will each contain a different 
recipe presented through images, descriptions, and lists. This project will
be revisted in the future. [7/1/23]
